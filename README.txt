This project contains our Project 3 files, this README file, and D4 which contains answers to 5 questions that were given to us. The project 3 files are as follows: pointer.py, part1.py, part2.py, and en-fr.xml. Pointer.py is a file that allows for back-tracing in our edit distance algorithm in our alignment string algorithm. part1.py contains our edit distance algorithm. To run part 1 you go to terminal and navigate to where you stored your files. Then you type python3 (to make sure you are using the python version 3) part1.py 'word1' 'word2'. This script will the display the edit distance between the two words given. In order to run part2.py which contains our percent match script along with T5 you must do the following. Open terminal and navigate to where to program is stored. Type 'python3 part2.py en-fr.tmx'. This will take around 10-15 minutes to run. This program works by selecting 10,000 English translation, 10,000 of the french equivalent of the english, and from those remaining 10,000 sentences it selects 5 MTBT sentences. The output then displays the top 10 percent matches and then following those it will display the top 10 edit distance found by the script. This simplifies the process instead of selecting 3 different files, it will select all the needed values from the single tmx file given. This means every time it runs it will select a different 5 sentences to be used as the MTBT sentences.
