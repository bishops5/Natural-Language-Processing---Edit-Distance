This project contains our Project 3 files, this README file, and D4 which contains answers to 5 questions that were given to us. The project 3 files are as follows: part1.py, part2.py, project3_analysis.txt (the analysis as needed in task 6), and en-fr.tmx. 

The part1.py file contains our edit distance algorithm. To run part 1 you go to terminal and navigate to where you stored your files. Then you type "python3 part1.py word1 word2" (without quotations), where "python3" is to make sure you are using the python version 3, "part1.py" is the file name for task 1 and task 2, "word1" would be a word you (the user) decide to enter, and "word2" would be another word you decide to enter. This script will the display the edit distance between the two words given, and the edit distance alignment.

In order to run part2.py which contains our edit distance score and percent match script along with T5, you must do the following. Open terminal and navigate to where to program is stored. Type "python3 part2.py en-fr.tmx" (without quotations), where python3 is to make sure you are using the python version 3, "part2.py" is the file name for task T5, and "en-fr.tmx" is the English-French parallel corpus. This will take around 10-15 minutes to run. This program works by selecting 10,000 English translation, 10,000 of the French equivalent of the English, and from those remaining 10,000 sentences it selects 5 MTBT sentences. The output then displays the top 10 percent matches and then following those it will display the top 10 edit distance found by the script. This simplifies the process instead of selecting 3 different files, it will select all the needed values from the single tmx file given. This means every time it runs it will select a different 5 sentences to be used as the MTBT sentences.
