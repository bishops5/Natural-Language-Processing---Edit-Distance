Our TM Retrieval program for T5 works by taking in the 10,000 English sentences and the French translations of the English sentences, and 5 MTBT sentences are picked from that pile, in which each sentence selected is removed from the 10,000 sentences. This prevents the same sentences from being selected. The output displays the top 10 Percent Matches and then following those it will display the Top 10 Edit Distance found by the script.

In the results of our T5, the Percent Match score was generally higher than the Edit Distance Score. However, Percent Match may not be the better TM metric, since context isn't taken into play. According to the "Translation Memory Retrieval Systems" paper published in the Proceedings of the European Association for Computational 
Linguistics 2014, there may be words that translate differently based on the context of the words being used. Therefore, even with a lower scoring value with the Edit Distance Score TM metric, it would be a better TM metric to use for our English-French translations case.
